# Machine-Learning-3.0
### By Quinn Okabayashi

An implementation of the ID3 decision tree algorithm in pure Python.

This project is the original version of a project I did for a highschool course.
The refactored project can be found [here](https://github.com/QnnOkabayashi/DecisionTreeID3).

**The code in the repository is not indicative of my current programming abilities, and is meant to serve as a reference point to the refactored version for my growth as a programmer.**
